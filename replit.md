# Auto MDD - Master Data Definition Generator

## Overview

Auto MDD is a Flask-based web application that automates the creation of Master Data Definition (MDD) templates and DQ (Data Quality) generation for clinical studies. The system uses OpenAI for semantic matching and pseudo code generation, combined with FAISS vector database for efficient similarity search.

The application compares target study DQ entries against a multi-tiered library of historical MDDs using semantic vector matching, computes confidence scores through hybrid similarity models, and auto-populates MDD templates with enriched metadata.
